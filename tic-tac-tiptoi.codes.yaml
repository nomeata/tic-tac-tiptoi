# This file contains a mapping from script names to oid codes.
# This way the existing scripts are always assigned to the the

# You can copy the contents of this file into the main .yaml file,
# if you want to have both together.
# 
# If you delete this file, the next run of "ttool assemble" might
# use different codes for your scripts, and you might have to re-
# create the images for your product.
